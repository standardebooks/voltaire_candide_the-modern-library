					<p>Venereal disease was said to have been first brought from Hispaniola, in the West Indies, by some followers of Columbus who were later employed in the siege of Naples. From this latter circumstance it was at one time known as the Neapolitan disease. <a href="chapter-4.xhtml#noteref-3" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>Such was the aversion of the Japanese to the Christian faith that they compelled Europeans trading with their islands to trample on the cross, renounce all marks of Christianity, and swear that it was not their religion. See chapter <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XI</span> of the voyage to Laputa in Swift’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Gulliver’s Travels</i>. <a href="chapter-5.xhtml#noteref-5" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>The sanbenito was a kind of loose over-garment painted with flames, figures of devils, the victim’s own portrait, <abbr>etc.</abbr>, worn by persons condemned to death by the Inquisition when going to the stake on the occasion of an auto-da-fé. Those who expressed repentance for their errors wore a garment of the same kind covered with flames directed downwards, while that worn by Jews, sorcerers, and renegades bore a <abbr>St.</abbr> Andrew’s cross before and behind. <a href="chapter-6.xhtml#noteref-8" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

						<p>“This Notre-Dame is of wood; every year she weeps on the day of her fête, and the people weep also. One day the preacher, seeing a carpenter with dry eyes, asked him how it was that he did not dissolve in tears when the Holy Virgin wept. ‘Ah, my reverend father,’ replied he, ‘it is I who refastened her in her niche yesterday. I drove three great nails through her behind; it is then she would have wept if she had been able.’ ”</p>

					<p>The following posthumous note of Voltaire’s was first added to <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">M.</abbr> Beuchot’s edition of his works issued in 1829: <q>“See the extreme discretion of the author; there has not been up to the present any Pope named Urban <span epub:type="z3998:roman">X</span>; he feared to give a bastard to a known Pope. What circumspection! What delicacy of conscience!”</q> The last Pope Urban was the eighth, and he died in 1644. <a href="chapter-11.xhtml#noteref-10" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>Jean Robeck, a Swede, who was born in 1672, will be found mentioned in Rousseau’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Nouvelle Héloïse</i>. He drowned himself in the Weser at Bremen in 1729, and was the author of a Latin treatise on voluntary death, first printed in 1735. <a href="chapter-12.xhtml#noteref-14" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>Later Voltaire substituted the name of the Father Croust for that of Didrie.

					<p>It has been suggested that Voltaire, in speaking of red sheep, referred to the llama, a South American ruminant allied to the camel.

					<p>The first English translator curiously gives “a tourene of bouilli that weighed two hundred pounds,” as the equivalent of “<i xml:lang="fr">un contour bouilli qui pesait deux cent livres</i>.” The French editor of the 1869 reprint points out that the South American vulture, or condor, is meant; the name of this bird, it may be added, is taken from <i xml:lang="x-tribal">cuntur</i>, that given it by the aborigines. <a href="chapter-17.xhtml#noteref-19" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p><i>Socinians</i>; followers of the teaching of Lalius and Faustus Socinus (16th century), which denied the doctrine of the Trinity, the deity of Christ, the personality of the devil, the native and total depravity of man, the vicarious atonement and eternal punishment. The Socinians are now represented by the Unitarians. <i>Manicheans</i>; followers of Manes or Manichæus (3rd century), a Persian who maintained that there are two principles, the one good and the other evil, each equally powerful in the government of the world. <a href="chapter-20.xhtml#noteref-21" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>In the 1759 editions, in place of the long passage in brackets from here to page 215, there was only the following: <q>“ ‘Sir,’ said the Perigordian Abbé to him, ‘have you noticed that young person who has so roguish a face and so fine a figure? You may have her for ten thousand francs a month, and fifty thousand crowns in diamonds.’ ‘I have only a day or two to give her,’ answered Candide, ‘because I have a rendezvous at Venice.’ In the evening after supper the insinuating Perigordian redoubled his politeness and attentions.”</q> <a href="chapter-22.xhtml#noteref-22" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>In France actors were at one time looked upon as excommunicated persons, not worthy of burial in holy ground or with Christian rites. In 1730 the “<span xml:lang="fr">honours of sepulture</span>” were refused to Mademoiselle Lecouvreur (doubtless the Miss Monime of this passage).

					<p>Élie-Catherine Fréron was a French critic (1719⁠–⁠1776) who incurred the enmity of Voltaire. In 1752 Fréron, in <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book" xml:lang="fr">Lettres sur quelques écrits du temps</i>, wrote pointedly of Voltaire as one who chose to be all things to all men, and Voltaire retaliated by references such as these in <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Candide</i>. <a href="chapter-22.xhtml#noteref-25" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>Commenting upon this passage, <cite>M. Sarcey</cite> says admirably: <q>“All is there! In those ten lines Voltaire has gathered all the griefs and all the terrors of these creatures; the picture is admirable for its truth and power! But do you not feel the pity and sympathy of the painter? Here irony becomes sad, and in a way an avenger. Voltaire cries out with horror against the society which throws some of its members into such an abyss. He has his ‘Bartholomew’ fever; we tremble with him through contagion.”</q> <a href="chapter-24.xhtml#noteref-33" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

Ivan <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VI</span> (<i>b.</i> 1740, <i>d.</i> 1762) was dethroned in 1741. Charles Edward Stuart, the Pretender (<i>b.</i> 1720, <i>d.</i> 1788).
